Post Mortem

Project Overview:
Theme: Quality Education

The game idea was to create various levels that mimic real life animal habitats and environments in a very basic and understandable way 
The target audience was kids around 6-8 years old as they were very simple games with designs catered to younger audiences
The goal was to educate players on the different animals and habitats around the world and how they live their lives, whether that be by teaching them what they hunt, or if they have any hinderances in vision these were mimicked to give them a more lifelike feel.

What went right (10 things)
Team roles were decided straight away and this helped when it came to presentations and team leading, and so forth
Target Theme was reached with an interesting twist which can also be built on upon
Presentation went very well as the game ran smoothly and with no errors
Implementation of AI Techniques was very efficient 


What went wrong (10 things)
Team was a bit dependent on 3rd year as certain aspects were harder to implement than others
The graphics students weren't the most useful which led to very choppy animations
Divison of work could have been better as certain students were overexhausted at the end of the day
Allocation of time was not done correctly and as such, the bulk of the work was left to the end
Certain bugs occurred whenever we transferred files from one person to another which was causing us problems to compile the final game

Risk Management:
Time allocation and management needs to be done better as last minute testing is not really the best idea

Mid-Project Changes:
At first we had a different idea in mind however due to logical reasons, and due to the short time limit it had to be changed
This wasn't the most ideal as we were scrapped
