    "# List Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to sequence operations and list methods, Python includes a more advanced/elegent operation called a list comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions allow us to build out lists using a different notation. You can think of it as essentially a one line <code>for</code> loop built inside of square brackets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, we want to separate the letters of the word <code>human</code> and add the letters as items of a list. The first thing that comes in mind would be using for loop. We would come up with something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    hlist = []\n",
    "    for letter in \"human\":\n",
    "        hlist.append(letter)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    print(hlist)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run the program, the output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ['h', 'u', 'm', 'a', 'n']\n",
    "    \n",
    "However, the above can be done more elegently using list comprehension:\n",
    "\n",
    "    hlist = [letter for letter in \"human\"]\n",
    "    print(hlist)\n",
    "    \n",
    "In the above example, a new list is assigned to variable hlist, and list contains the items of the iterable string \"human\". \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the basic idea of a list comprehension. If you're familiar with mathematical notation this format should feel familiar for example: x^2 : x in { 0,1,2...10 } "
