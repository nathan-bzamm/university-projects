          <h1>Attractions one may find in Turin<h1>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">The city of Turin has a large number of attractions due to its rich and vast history. These attractions range from Museums, to football stadiums.</p>

       <h2>The Mole Antonelliana<h2>
         <div class="clearfix">
           <img class="img1" src="the_mole.jpg" alt="Mole_Antonelliana" width="500" height="300">
           <p style="font-size:20px;">From Piazza Castello, the arcaded Via Po runs to the Piazza Vittorio Veneto and the Po River. Just north of Via Po rises the huge Mole Antonelliana, begun by Alessandro Antonelli in 1863 as a synagogue, with a 168-meter-tall spire added in 1878 to 1880. Not only is this the most recognizable landmark on Turin's skyline, but the tower offers spectacular 360-degree views across the city to the surrounding hills and the Savoy Alps. The ride to the top in the glass elevator is an experience you won't forget, as it provides a dizzying and dramatic look at the National Museum of Cinema, which occupies the interior of the building. The museum is perhaps best described by its designer, François Confino: "A full-immersion plunge into the world of images in motion and fiction." Even those with little interest in motion pictures will enjoy this museum, but you can also ride the lift to the top for a separate fee from the museum admission.</p>

         <h3>Palazzo Reale<h3>
           <div class ="clearfix">
             <img class="img2" src="Palazzo_Reale.jpg" alt=PalazzoReale" width="450" height="250">
             <p style="font-size:20px;">Filling an entire side of the large Piazza Castello in the center of Turin, the former Royal Palace is a relatively plain 17th-century building, at least on the outside. But step inside to be dazzled by the Appartamento di Madama Felicità and 26 sumptuously decorated state apartments (Reali Appartamenti). In the right wing, the former Royal Armory (Armeria Reale) contains one of the largest collections of arms and armor in Europe, with complete suits of armor and other items dating from the 15th to 19th centuries. The library, which has a separate entrance to the far left, is one of Italy's most impressive. Beyond the Palazzo Reale are the beautiful Royal Gardens (Giardini Reali) at the corner of which (the entrance is on Corso Regina Margherita) is the Museo d'Antichità, filled with archaeological finds dating from prehistoric times through the late Roman era.</p>
           </div>
           <h4>Allianz Stadium<h4>
             <div class ="clearfix">
               <img class="img3" src="Allianz_Stadium.jpg" alt="Juventus_Stadium" width="500" height="300">
               <p style="font-size:20px;">Strictly for football (soccer) fans and a must-see for followers of Turin's Juventus, the stadium is officially called the Allianz Stadium, but in Turin it's simply known as The Stadium. You can visit to see the museum and take a guided tour through the facilities, visiting the locker rooms, press box, and the pitch itself (but not a chance to sit in the stands). Tours are offered in English, and exhibits in the museum are labeled in English, as well. In it you can see the trophy room, uniforms, memorabilia, and a film about the team and its fans. The shop is filled with Juv souvenirs. Note that the museum and stadium tour require separate tickets; one does not include the other. In this grand football stadium countless teams lost to the incredible football team Juventus, and countless trophies were won.</p>

             <h5>Piazza San Carlo<h5>
               <div class ="clearfix">
                 <img class="img4" src="italy-turin-piazza-san-carlo.jpg" alt="Piazza_San_Carlo" width="500" height="250">
                 <p style="font-size:20px;">Turin is a city of beautiful squares and avenues, but no place is lovelier than the arcaded Piazza San Carlo, surrounded by arcaded buildings and punctuated at one end by the matching facades of the churches of Santa Cristina and San Carlo. Beneath the arcades are some of Turin's most stylish shops and the historic cafés where Italy's Risorgimento was plotted in the mid-1800s. In the center of the square stands an imposing equestrian statue of Duke Emmanuel Philibert (1838), who seems to be choreographing the activity below. Look on the pavement under the arcades for the works — often in progress — of Turin's talented chalk artists. Also under the piazza's arcades (as well as those along nearby Via Po) are some of the favorite places for shopping in Turin.</p>
